## Project Description
This project was for the California State University Sacramento Esports Club. This project was to help the club have more outreach and allow for the club to have a more professional look.

## Background
The Esports Club of California State University Sacramento is an "Electronic Sports" club that hosts both casual and competitive video game events. The club is meant for bringing together students that are just interested in video games as well those who want to compete in gaming leagues and tournaments. Our client is Isaac Rodriguez, the current president, and Sean Tirado, the future president, of the California State University Sacramento Esports Club.

## Installation
To open in edit these files you fitst must download a development environment, or IDE. We uised VIsual Studion code to make all of our edits when creating the files.
The link to downloading the IDE can be found here: [Visual Sudio Code Download](https://code.visualstudio.com "Visual Sudio Code Download"). Once the IDE has been downloaded you must download the repository. At the top of this page you will find a green button labled code "code". This is shown in the figure below.
